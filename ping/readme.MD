This is a very generic REST service.  


Notes on testing:
For the test suite, we use jest and supertest (see section 10, lecture 198 of 
microsoervices course).  We installed with

npm install --save-dev jest supertest 

In the lecture, they also included mongodb-memory-server.  Not included here
because this service has no db
